# **Machine Learning: Project Part 1 - Audio Analysis**

---

## **Objective**

This project aims to process audio files of interviews or debates and extract valuable information. The system:
- Identifies who speaks and when (speaker diarisation).
- Transcribes the audio for each speaker.
- Leverages large language models for sentiment analysis or speaker name identification.
- Provides a summary of each speakerâ€™s total speaking time.
